# Performance Optimization Implementation Summary

## Task 15: Add performance optimization and cleanup

This document summarizes the performance optimizations and cleanup mechanisms implemented for the Session Recap Extension.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Efficient File Watching with Debouncing

**Location**: `src/services/FileChangeMonitor.ts`

**Optimizations**:
- **Debouncing**: 500ms debounce delay to prevent excessive processing during high-frequency file changes
- **Memory Management**: Limited to tracking 1000 files maximum to prevent memory issues
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Comprehensive exclude patterns for temporary files, system files, build outputs, and IDE files
- **Cleanup Intervals**: Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes to remove old file edits (>24 hours)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated performance timers for all operations

**Key Features**:
- Prevents duplicate events within 1-second windows
- Removes oldest 10% of files when limit is reached
- Clears expired debounce timers automatically
- Proper resource disposal with cleanup

### 2. Git Command Execution and Caching

**Location**: `src/services/GitActivityMonitor.ts`

**Optimizations**:
- **Repository Detection Caching**: Caches Git repository status to avoid repeated file system checks
- **Branch Name Caching**: 30-second cache for current branch name
- **Commits Caching**: Caches commit results with 30-second timeout and 10-entry limit
- **Optimized Parsing**: Limits files per commit to 50 to prevent memory issues
- **Error Handling**: Caches error results to avoid repeated failed operations

**Key Features**:
- Memory-managed cache with automatic cleanup
- Graceful handling of malformed Git output
- Performance monitoring for all Git operations
- Proper timeout handling (5-10 seconds for Git commands)

### 3. Terminal Error Monitoring with Debouncing

**Location**: `src/services/TerminalErrorMonitor.ts`

**Optimizations**:
- **Output Debouncing**: 300ms debounce delay for terminal output processing
- **Buffer Management**: Limited buffer size (100 lines per terminal) with memory management
- **Line Length Limits**: Maximum 1000 characters per line to prevent performance issues
- **Data Truncation**: Truncates very long data chunks (>10KB) with indicator
- **Optimized Pattern Matching**: Fast-path checks for common error/warning patterns
- **Periodic Cleanup**: 2-minute intervals to clear old buffers and stale timers

**Key Features**:
- Processes most recent errors first (reverse order)
- Clears processed buffers to free memory
- Handles non-existent terminals gracefully
- Performance monitoring integration

### 4. Memory Management and Cleanup

**Location**: `src/services/PerformanceOptimizer.ts`

**New Service Features**:
- **Memory Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with 30-second intervals
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic GC suggestions when heap usage exceeds 100MB
- **Cooldown Management**: 5-minute cooldown between GC suggestions
- **Performance Reporting**: 30-minute intervals with detailed metrics
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Automated analysis and suggestions
- **File Watching Optimization**: Configures VS Code settings for optimal performance

**Key Features**:
- Memory usage alerts when exceeding 50MB threshold
- Identifies slow operations (>50ms average)
- Tracks memory-intensive operations (>1MB average)
- Provides actionable optimization recommendations

### 5. Performance Monitoring and Metrics Collection

**Location**: `src/services/PerformanceMonitor.ts`

**Enhanced Features**:
- **Operation Timing**: High-precision timing for all operations
- **Memory Delta Tracking**: Tracks memory usage changes per operation
- **Slow Operation Detection**: Logs operations taking >100ms
- **Metrics Aggregation**: Accumulates statistics (min, max, average, total calls)
- **Performance Summaries**: Detailed reporting with memory usage breakdown

**Key Features**:
- Singleton pattern for global access
- Automatic slow operation logging
- Memory usage formatting (bytes to human-readable)
- Comprehensive disposal and cleanup

## Performance Requirements Met

### Requirement 2.4: File Change Tracking Optimization
✅ **Implemented**: Debouncing, memory limits, intelligent filtering, and cleanup intervals

### Requirement 3.5: Git Performance Optimization  
✅ **Implemented**: Caching, optimized parsing, memory management, and error handling

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **PerformanceOptimizer**: 16 tests covering memory management, reporting, and cleanup
- **PerformanceMonitor**: 14 tests covering timing, metrics, and resource management
- **TerminalErrorMonitor**: 59 tests including 12 new performance optimization tests
- **GitActivityMonitor**: Performance-specific tests for caching and optimization

### Performance Test Categories
1. **Memory Management**: Buffer limits, cleanup intervals, memory leak prevention
2. **Debouncing**: Rapid input handling, timer management, resource cleanup
3. **Caching**: Cache hits/misses, expiration, memory limits
4. **Pattern Matching**: Fast-path optimizations, regex performance
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal, timer clearing, memory freeing

## Integration Points

### SessionTracker Integration
- **PerformanceOptimizer**: Integrated into SessionTracker for system-wide optimization
- **Throttled Updates**: 1-second throttle for sidebar updates to prevent UI lag
- **Git Update Intervals**: 30-second intervals for Git commit updates
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of session data on disposal

### Extension Integration
- **Startup Optimization**: Performance monitoring starts with extension activation
- **Configuration**: File watching optimizations applied automatically
- **Resource Management**: All services properly disposed on extension deactivation

## Performance Metrics

### Memory Usage Targets
- **Heap Usage**: <50MB during normal operation (monitored and alerted)
- **File Tracking**: Limited to 1000 files maximum
- **Git Cache**: Limited to 10 entries maximum
- **Terminal Buffers**: Limited to 100 lines per terminal

### Timing Targets
- **Extension Activation**: <500ms (design requirement)
- **File Change Processing**: Debounced to prevent excessive CPU usage
- **Git Operations**: 5-10 second timeouts with caching
- **UI Updates**: <100ms with throttling (design requirement)
